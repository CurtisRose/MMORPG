I am making the game like runescape but I want to add some dungeon crawler carl aspects to it.

I like the idea that you can level up a skill like runescape, but also abilities like dungeon crawler carl, but also I'd like proficienies in gear. So just because you are good at a long sword doesn't mean you are good at a short sword. But If you are good at melee, then it's not like you will be ASS at shortsword just because you've never used it. That sort of thing. Then maybe even go deeper into specific items.

Maybe it will look like:
    50% of skill comes from category (swords/daggers/spears)
    40% from type of sword (short/long/et cetera)
    10% from actual item (bastard sword [a type of longsword] or the devils plaything [a special type of dagger])
